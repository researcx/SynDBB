Creates a ZNC user with the users' name and the IRC auth key provided in their preferences.

Requires https://github.com/faggqt/znc-httpadmin to be installed on the ZNC server and the IRC and ZNC details set properly inside the config file.

You should have a specific ZNC user with admin privileges which only the server's IP has permission to contact.
